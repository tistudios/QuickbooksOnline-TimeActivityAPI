1. Move over information from TimeActivity Api Call script to just apiCall
2. Change mentions of apiCall within Index.php
3. Edit refreshtokens.php as well.
4. Configure local ngrok server for security while doing this.
5. Test on development and if everything works, roll out to production.
Ensure API GETs and POSTs are valid, and once finished above look for integration to Tableau.
